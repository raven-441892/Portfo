# Portfolio
Overview
This Portfolio repository consist the weekly tasks of our course Fundamental of Computer Programming. Each week has tasks that teaches basic topic of python fundamentals, such as variables,functions, list, tuple, set and many more.... 

Week 1 tasks:
F-string formatting is a distinctive and straightforward way to format and print strings in Python. It allows you to embed expressions directly into strings, making the code cleaner and more readable by easily incorporating variables or expressions within the text to be printed.

Week 2 tasks:
Exploring logic in coding involves understanding various operators and how they function. Learning about different operators provides insight into how they're applied within code to perform specific tasks, allowing for more versatile and intricate programming. For instance, logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT are fundamental for creating complex conditions in code, enabling you to make decisions and control program flow effectively.

Week 3 tasks:
Understanding 'if' conditions and nested 'if' statements is crucial in programming. They allow you to create decision-making structures within your code. Indentation plays a significant role in Python, as it determines the scope or block of code belonging to a particular condition. Proper indentation ensures clarity and correctness in the logic of your code, especially in nested structures where different levels of conditions are present.

Week 4 tasks:
Working with functions involves creating reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. By using function calls, you can execute these blocks of code whenever needed, making your programs modular and easier to manage. Modular programming involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable functions, which can be called as needed. This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and reusability by organizing functionalities into distinct modules or functions.

Week 5 tasks:
Learning about scripts and modules in programming involves understanding how to organize and structure your code. A script is typically a standalone file containing executable code, while modules are reusable pieces of code that can be imported into other scripts or modules to provide specific functionalities.
Importing modules in Python can be done in various ways. The import statement is the most common method, allowing you to bring in an entire module or specific functions/classes from a module. Additionally, there's the from ... import ... syntax, which enables importing specific components directly into your script's namespace without using the module's name as a prefix.

Week 6 tasks:
Delving into lists and tuples introduces the concept of mutable and immutable structures in Python. Lists, marked by their mutability, allow for alterations to their elements—additions, removals, or modifications—while tuples, immutable by nature, remain fixed once they're created, prohibiting any changes to their elements.
Completed: 12th December, 2023

Week 7 tasks:
Exploring sets and dictionaries in Python involves understanding two distinct data structures.
Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They don't allow duplicate values, and they're mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after creation. Sets are defined using curly braces {}.
Dictionaries: Dictionaries, often referred to as dicts, are collections of key-value pairs. They are unordered and mutable, allowing for easy retrieval, addition, deletion, and modification of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.
